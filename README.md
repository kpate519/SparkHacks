### **Special Shoutout** ðŸŽ‰  
A huge thank you to the **Fulcrum GT Mentors** for providing invaluable guidance and inspiration, helping us refine our approach and direction throughout this project!

---

### **What does our app do?**  
Everyday 2.0 elevates the existing UIC dining hall app, specifically designed to help students locate **water refill stations** across UIC's entire campus (both east and west campuses).  

---

### **What problem does it solve?**  
We all know that staying hydrated is crucial, but many students struggle to find working water refill stations. It's even more frustrating when a station is out of order due to a filter issue.
Everyday 2.0 addresses these pain points by making it easy for students to stay hydrated and reduce plastic waste.

---

### **Why is it useful?**  
- **Health**: Ensures that students stay hydrated with easy access to clean water.
- **Sustainability**: Encourages the use of **reusable water bottles** and reduces reliance on single-use plastic.
- **Convenience**: Saves time by helping students locate functioning water stations without wandering across campus.

---

### **Who will benefit from it?**  
- **Everyone on campus**! Students, staff, and facultyâ€”essentially, anyone who drinks water!  
- The app contributes to sustainability and health goals for the campus, with a theme for this yearâ€™s hackathon focusing on **Under the C**, which ties in beautifully with reducing plastic waste and promoting hydration.

---

### **How did we come up with this idea?**  
We started by thinking about the daily challenges of college life, focusing on the importance of hydration and sustainability. After realizing how hard it can be to find a water refill station, especially when filters are broken, we decided to include a map of all the water refill stations on campus.
