### **Special Shoutout** ðŸŽ‰  
A huge thank you to the **Fulcrum GT Mentors** for providing invaluable guidance and inspiration, helping us refine our approach and direction throughout this project!

---

### **What does our app do?**  
Everyday 2.0 elevates the existing UIC dining hall app, specifically designed to help students locate **water refill stations** across UIC's entire campus (both east and west campuses).  

---

### **What problem does it solve?**  
We all know that staying hydrated is crucial, but many students struggle to find working water refill stations. It's even more frustrating when a station is out of order due to a filter issue.
Everyday 2.0 addresses these pain points by making it easy for students to stay hydrated and reduce plastic waste.

---

### **Why is it useful?**  
- **Health**: Ensures that students stay hydrated with easy access to clean water.
- **Sustainability**: Encourages the use of **reusable water bottles** and reduces reliance on single-use plastic.
- **Convenience**: Saves time by helping students locate functioning water stations without wandering across campus.

---

### **Who will benefit from it?**  
- **Everyone on campus**! Students, staff, and facultyâ€”essentially, anyone who drinks water!  
- The app contributes to sustainability and health goals for the campus, with a theme for this yearâ€™s hackathon focusing on **Under the C**, which ties in beautifully with reducing plastic waste and promoting hydration.

---

### **How did we come up with this idea?**  
We started by thinking about the daily challenges of college life, focusing on the importance of hydration and sustainability. 
After realizing how hard it can be to find a water refill station, especially when filters are broken. We decided to include a map of all the water refill stations on campus.

### **Instructions on how to run our project**  
(Include simple steps here based on your setup, such as cloning the repo, opening in Xcode, or installing dependencies.)
- Clone repo from Github
- Open in XCode
- Select the scheme and target device
- Run the app by clicking on the play icon

---

### **Tech Stack & Code Structure Overview**

- **Frontend**: Swift (for iOS development), **Figma** (for design)
- **Backend**: OpenStreetMap API (for location data)
- **Libraries/Tools**:  Swift Libraries - Foundation
  - **MapKit**: iOS maps and location services
  - **CoreLocation**: GPS-based location tracking
  - **Figma**: UI/UX design
  - **Canva**: App Cover Icon


---

### **Key Features**  
- **Map Integration**: An interactive map shows you the refill stations on campus.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive design that makes navigation effortless.
  
---

### **Future Improvements**  
Weâ€™re excited to work on some awesome new features after the hackathon:
- **Real-time Business Traffic**: Weâ€™ve mocked up a feature using GPS and Wi-Fi to track traffic within dining halls and display peak times.
- **Push Notifications**: Let users know when theyâ€™re near an available refill station.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: We'll refine the design based on user feedback to ensure a seamless experience.
- **Filter Status**: Stay updated with the status of water refill stations (e.g., Green: great filter quality, Yellow: okay filter quality, Red: poor filter quality/needs to be replaced, and default is set to unavailable status).
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Easily find the nearest water refill stations based on your current location.

---

### **Challenges We Faced**
- **Identifying the Problem**: We didnâ€™t want to create a solution just for the sake of it; we aimed to solve a real, relatable problem. Our solution revolves around improving hydration habits, a simple but essential part of student life.
- **Setting Up Xcode and Swift**: This was our teamâ€™s first experience with both tools, which presented some technical hurdles early on.
- **Design to Code Integration**: Translating our Figma designs to Swift UI involved a steep learning curve, but we were able to connect everything through plugins and custom adjustments.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from the OpenStreetMap API and parsing it into a usable JSON format was tricky, but we managed to implement it with precise coordinate retrieval for water refill stations.

### **Acknowledgements**  
A HUGE **thank you** to the **SparkHacks team** and all the sponsors. Without your support, this project and event wouldnâ€™t have been possible. 
We're also grateful for the guidance and mentorship we received during the hackathon.

### **Conclusion**

Everyday 2.0 is more than just an app; itâ€™s a step toward better hydration, sustainability, and student well-being. With simple solutions to everyday challenges, 
we aim to make it easier for UIC students to stay hydrated and reduce their environmental impact.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
